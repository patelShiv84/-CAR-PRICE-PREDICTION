# 🚗 Car Price Prediction – ML Project

### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **selling price of used cars** using a machine learning model built with Python. It handles everything from data preprocessing to deployment on a web interface using **Streamlit**.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** – Programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visualizations
- **scikit-learn** – For preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- **Streamlit** – For building the web interface
- **joblib** – For saving the model and pipeline

---

### 📊 ML Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed null values and irrelevant columns
   - Converted categorical data where needed

2. **Outlier Handling**
   - Handled outliers using IQR and statistical techniques

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features like polynomial and interaction terms
   - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Used `MinMaxScaler` to normalize numerical features

5. **Model Training**
   - Trained a `LinearRegression` model
   - Optimized with hyperparameters and pipeline setup

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score

7. **Model Deployment**
   - Built an interactive web app using **Streamlit**
   - Users can input car specs and get real-time price predictions
